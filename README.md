It is a classification problem. We have to classify that the given mail (body of mail)
is spam (1) or ham (0).
In dataset.csv there is our data.
In templates folder there is home.html it is starting page.
Here we use Naive Bayes Classifier to classify the given mail is spam or ham.
In Naive Bayes we use Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier as it is suitable for 
classification with discrete features (e.g., word counts for text classification).
